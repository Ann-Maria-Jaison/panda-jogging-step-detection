# Happy National Panda Day(March 16) 🐼

## 📌 Overview
The **Panda Steps Counter** is a fun and interactive motion-based web app that tracks your steps using your device's motion sensor and converts them into "panda steps." The app consists of two sections:
- **Human Steps** - Displays the total steps detected from motion.
- **Panda Steps** - Converts human steps into panda steps at a scaled-down rate (1 panda step for every 2.5 human steps).

A floating panda animation reacts to movement, making the experience engaging. If the panda steps exceed 50, a fun message appears. If the device doesn't support motion detection, a warning is displayed.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time step counting using motion sensors 📱
- Panda-themed UI with a floating animation 🐼
- Two-step counters: **Human Steps** and **Panda Steps**
- Automatic step conversion (1 panda step = 2.5 human steps)
- Fun milestone message when reaching 50 panda steps 🌳

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML** for structure
- **CSS** for styling and animations
- **JavaScript** for motion detection and step counting


## 🎮 How to Use
1. Open the webpage on a mobile device (motion sensors required).
2. Start moving, and it will count your steps.
